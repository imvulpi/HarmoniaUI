/*! \page about About HarmoniaUI
HarmoniaUI is a UI library created for the Godot engine with the goal of making UI design easier and more versatile. 
With HarmoniaUI, developers can build complex UIs fast but without sacrificing control.
Our library takes inspiration from web and desktop UI systems, borrowing the features 
that users already love and expect while adapting them to the Godot environment.

## Why Choose HarmoniaUI

HarmoniaUI draws inspiration from many popular UI systems, combining their best features.
It allows for creation of responsive UIs that adapt to different screen sizes and resoluitions,
while also providing flexible laoyuts for organizing elements in different ways. With a variety of
visual styles HarmoniaUI gives you easy and engaging tools for creating visually appealing elements.
Whether you are creating HUDs or Menus, HarmoniaUI is there to support you!

With HarmoniaUI, you can style your scenes similar to CSS with responsive and relative UI,
also giving you easy to understand layout systems.

### Advantages:
- **Instant preview** in the editor
- **Responsive** design
- **Easy** to create and understand layouts
- **Relative units** like %, vw, vh, and more
- Easy visual styling like **backgrounds colors, shadows, borders and more**
- **Styling** similiar to Web
- And so **much more** ...

## Not exactly Web/CSS!

One of the key advantages of HarmoniaUI is that it does not rely on external text files like CSS. 
It only contains some of css features, but it doesn't rely on any CSS engines or files.
Everything is built directly on Godot nodes, which means you can create, adjust, and organize your UI elements 
without needing to switch between files. Not relying on CSS also means you can create your own HarmoniaUI nodes 
and you can manipulate the nodes in your scripts, changing their styles dynamically, handling events and more!

Changes are reflected instantly in the editor, giving you feedback as you design.

 <b>Vulpi</b>: I'm very open to some new layouts or improvements, so please contribute üòä

 ## Help us create better documentation
 There are topics that would appreciate some more descriptions or examples, and creating documentation pages is very easy.
 So if you ever feel like improving it a bit, read the below texts.

 ### Creating new pages
 Documentation pages are generated by Doxygen, to add new pages just add new .dox or .md file in the <c>./docs/pages</c>
 You can edit text to provide more detail or exampes, or add <b>new pages</b> on different topics.

 I recommend just copying one of the documentation pages and editing it to fit your idea.
 You can learn lot from the <a href="https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/index.html">Doxygen manual</a> or searching online, there is a lot of
 content!

 ### Doxygen is great
