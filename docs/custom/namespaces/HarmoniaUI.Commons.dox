 \namespace HarmoniaUI::Commons
 \brief Shared helper classes used in HarmoniaUI.

 \details
 The `Commons` contains helper and utility classes that help reduce the code
 or make the code more maintainable.

 That means `Commons` could be replaced without creating
 many problems with how the library works.

 Sometimes it provides a bit more performance, but usually it's about
 maintainability, simplicity and reusing.
