 \namespace HarmoniaUI::Tests
 \brief Test for verifying HarmoniaUI behaviour and maintainability.

 \details
 The `Tests` increase project maintainability,
 Tests define rules for nodes and other parts of the code.
 With tests developers can make changes or add features and 
 verify they aren't breaking other parts of the code.

 Tests aren't perfect, so bugs will still appear, but tests allow catching
 some of the problems before any release.

 The tests are written using <a href="https://github.com/MikeSchulze/gdUnit4">GDUnit4</a>
 a popular unit testing framework for Godot.
